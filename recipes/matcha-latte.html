    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A steaming hot matcha latte is a delicious drink that is easy to make at home. TV host, cookbook author, and blogger Molly Yeh shares her easy recipe that calls for matcha powder, milk, and honey for sweetness. A fine powder made of ground green tea leaves, matcha contributes an earthy, somewhat bitter flavor as well as bright green color. Making your own matcha latte not only saves you money but also allows you to control the level of sweetness. It's important to first sift and then whisk the matcha until there are no lumps; traditionally, a bamboo whisk is used, but a regular metal whisk will work just fine. To get a frothy finish, whip in the milk with a milk frother.</p>
    <p>There are three quality grades of matcha: ceremonial, latte, and cooking. Ceremonial is the highest quality with the smoothest flavor and brightest color; latte grade tastes more bitter and is less vibrant in color, while cooking has the most bitter flavor and is a greenish-brown.</p>
