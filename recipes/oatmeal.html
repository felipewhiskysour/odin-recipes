    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>When it comes to healthy breakfast recipes, overnight oats, egg muffins, chia seed pudding, 
        and shakshuka are always on repeat. But let’s not overlook the humble bowl of oatmeal! While
         this healthy recipe may seem like a no brainer, many folks often search for the perfect recipe
          – one that creates a rich, creamy, and fluffy pot of oatmeal. Well, your search can stop here as 
          I’ll show you how you can achieve the best bowl of oatmeal in a snap!</p>
          <p>Just remember this ratio 1:2. For every portion of oats, you need double the amount of liquid. 
            For a single serving with 1/2 cup of oats, that means you’ll need 1 cup of liquid.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rolled Oats:</strong> These will create deliciously creamy porridge in just 5 to 10 minutes. Remember to buy certified gluten-free oats if you’re gluten-sensitive or celiac.</li>
        <li><strong>Water or Milk:</strong> For the liquid you can use water, milk or dairy-free milk (like almond milk or cashew milk), it’s up to you! For that perfect level of creaminess, a 50/50 water and milk combo is great.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt will transform a bland bowl of oatmeal into a flavorful one. Trust me, don’t leave it out.</li>
        <li><strong>Toppings</strong>Have fun with spices, fruits, nuts, and so much more</li>
